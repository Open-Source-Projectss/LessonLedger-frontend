# Decentralized Academic Accountability Platform

A web application that helps learners organize, track, and stay accountable to their academic and career learning goals using structured roadmaps, task tracking, progress analytics, and blockchain-verified achievements.

##  Project Overview

This platform is **NOT** a teaching platform. Instead, it focuses on:

- **Structuring learning paths** - Hierarchical, expandable roadmaps for any skill
- **Breaking skills into step-by-step roadmaps** - Granular learning progression
- **Tracking study consistency** - Daily and weekly accountability
- **Managing daily and weekly tasks** - Organized task management
- **Monitoring progress and streaks** - Visual progress tracking and streak counters
- **Rewarding discipline and completion** - NFT-based achievement system

The app combines the best of:
- **Roadmap.sh** (learning paths)
- **Notion** (task tracking)
- **Duolingo** (streaks and gamification)
- **GitHub** (contribution tracking)

##  Core Features

### 1. **Learning Roadmaps**
- Pre-built learning paths for various domains (Frontend, Backend, Data Science, etc.)
- Hierarchical, expandable structure
- Community-contributed roadmaps
- Progress indicators for each topic

### 2. **Task & Study Tracking**
- Daily and weekly study goals
- Task management with reminders
- Calendar integration
- Study duration tracking

### 3. **Progress Dashboard**
- Progress bars and visual indicators
- Streak counter and consistency tracking
- Study analytics and heatmap (GitHub-style)
- Learning milestones

### 4. **NFT Achievement System**
- **Achievement NFTs** - Awarded for completing milestones
- **Reputation NFTs** - For contributors and active members
- **Dynamic NFTs** - Evolve as learners progress
- Gasless experience powered by Stellar

### 5. **Community System**
- Contributor profiles
- Community roadmap submissions
- Reputation tracking
- Open-source contribution rewards

### 6. **Authentication**
- Email/password authentication
- Google OAuth integration
- Optional wallet linking

### Authentication
- **Clerk** or **NextAuth.js** - Auth provider

##  MVP Scope (Phase 1)

Build FIRST (without advanced blockchain complexity):
- ✅ User authentication (email/password, Google OAuth)
- ✅ Learning roadmap system
- ✅ Daily/weekly task tracking
- ✅ Progress dashboard
- ✅ Streak tracking

##  Phase 2

Add:
- Stellar wallet integration
- Achievement NFTs
- Gas sponsorship (gasless transactions)

##  Phase 3

Add:
- Dynamic NFTs
- Community contribution rewards
- Public learner profiles
- Social/community features

##  Design Direction

UI should feel:
- Clean and minimal
- Modern and productivity-focused
- Intuitive and user-friendly

Inspiration: Notion, Linear, GitHub, Duolingo, Roadmap.sh

##  Web3 / Stellar Integration

The blockchain aspect is **invisible and stress-free** for users:
- ✅ No crypto knowledge required
- ✅ No manual wallet setup
- ✅ No gas fees (sponsored transactions)
- ✅ One-click NFT claiming
- ✅ Feels like a normal Web2 application

##  Open Source Features
